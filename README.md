#Library Management System

In this project, I've applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python to develop an advanced Library Management System. 
This command-line-based application is designed to streamline the management of books and resources within a library.

Key Features:

Book Operations: Add, borrow, return, search, and display books.
User Operations: Add users, view user details, and display all users.
Author Operations: Add authors, view author details, and display all authors.
Input Validation: Regex ensures valid input (e.g., date format and numeric library ID).
Error Handling: Uses try-except blocks for handling invalid input and other errors.
